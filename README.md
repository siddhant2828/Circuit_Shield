1.1 Back Ground And Context:-
There are many cases of death occurred due to the electric shock. The reason behind is 
many of the times lack of safety in electric circuit or appliances. To reduce this harmful 
effect, it is important to focus on safety of devices running on high voltage. The project 
focuses on enhancing the safety of live wires carrying current, particularly in household 
settings. When a load is not connected, the terminals connected to the load can contain high 
voltage, posing a potential danger to those who come into contact with the live wires. To 
address this issue, the project proposes the use of an automatic switch placed in the circuit.
1.2 Aim:-
To design a damage control and safety measurement live wire circuit using automatic 
switch.
1.3 Problem Definition :-
The design of the project focuses on enhancing the safety of live wires carrying current, 
particularly in household settings. When a load is not connected, the terminals connected 
to the load can contain high voltage, posing a potential danger to those who come into 
contact with the live wires. To address this issue the project should work properly.
1.4 Scope and Objective:-
1] To focus on household loads and their handling. 
2] To give safety measures for human beings. 
3] To detect faulty load. 
4] To avoid shock from moisture around the switch are
